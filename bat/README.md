# Introducing a decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on Ethereum Blockchain. #

## Problem: ##

Digital advertising is broken. The marketplace for online advertising, once dominated by advertisers, publishers and users, has become overrun by "middleman" ad exchanges,  audience  segmentation,  complicated  behavioral  and  cross-device  user tracking,  and  opaque  cross-party  sharing  through  data  management  platforms. Users  face  unprecedented  levels  of  malvertisements  and  privacy  violations.   Mobile advertising results in as much as $23 per month in data charges on the average
user’s data plan, slow page loads, and as much as 21% less battery life.  In response, over 600 million mobile devices and desktops (globally) employ ad blocking software and this number is growing.  Traditional publishers have lost approximately 66% of their revenue over the past decade, adjusted for inflation.  Publishers face falling  revenue,  users  feel  increasingly  violated,  and  advertisers’  ability  to  assess effectiveness is diminished.  

## Solution: ##

The solution is a decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on Blockchain.  

The first component is Brave, a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks third party ads and trackers, and builds in a ledger system that measures user attention to reward publishers accordingly.  

Second component is BAT (Basic Attention Token),  a token for a decentralized ad exchange.  It compensates the browser user for attention while protecting privacy. BAT  connects  advertisers,  publishers,  and  users  and  is  denominated  by  relevant user attention, while removing social and economic costs associated with existing
ad networks, e.g., fraud, privacy violations, and malvertising.  BAT is a payment system  that  rewards  and  protects  the  user  while  giving  better  conversion  to  ad vertisers and higher yield to publishers.  We see BAT and associated technologies as  a  future  part  of  web  standards,  solving  the  important  problem  of  monetizing publisher content while protecting user privacy.
